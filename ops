It has _Ralink RT5372_ chipset, so, according the [list of supported devices](https://github.com/bortek/EZ-WifiBroadcast/wiki/List-of-Wifi-cards-and-doungles) it should work.\n\nAnswering on your questions I've got that Its **not** 5Ghz capable.\n\nI'm trying to establish wifibroadcasting using Ubuntu 16.04, with **TP-Link TL-WN822N** and _raspberry pi3_ with **D-Link DWA-137** on board.\n\nI've made everything via [instructions](https://dev.px4.io/en/qgc/video_streaming_wifi_broadcast.html) but have some issues. To test my environment I've ran your [advice](https://github.com/svpcom/wifibroadcast/issues/7#issuecomment-313427280) and have had **-22** error.\n\nI think that this is right conversation for mine question.\n\nCan you advice how can I change _scripts_ from `scripts` to run test?\n\nAfter running `./rx` on mine _Ubuntu_ with **TP-Link TL-WN822N** I see text line with message in _terminal_ , but when I'm running `./tx` on _Raspberry Pi3_ with **D-Link DWA-137** I don't see any messages, just silence in _terminal_.\n\nI've not patched my kernel with patches from `patches` _directory_. I hope this is not the reason of this issue.","files":null}]}
