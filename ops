I've been wanting to try a 5.8ghz system, it's in my backlog of drone projects. I think the increased bandwidth would provide excellent video with low latency, but the link would not be anywhere near as resilient to weather and long range as 2.4ghz. Still, I think swapping out the cards for a Alfa AWUS036ACH or something similar would be cool. Let us know what comes of your work!","files":null}]}
