Either it can't decrypt or it fails to receive at all. Have tried both 5G and 2G but no difference. There must be some steps that I missed.  I'll try the trouble-shooting solution.\nA few more questions:\n1. For telemetry, can I use port=5600 and 14550 for both TX and RX, for wifibroadcast.cfg?\n2. When  I run ./script/tx_standalone,sh wlan1, will wifibroadcast.cfg work? From what I can tell, it won't but just to confirm.\n3. for TX, \n \"raspivid --nopreview --awb auto -ih -t 0 -w 640 -h 480 -fps 30 -b 4000000 -g 30 -pf high -o - | gst-launch-1.0 fdsrc ! h264parse ! rtph264pay !  udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5600\"\nIs the \"4000000\" correct or should I use \"4000\"?","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1548428935,"nonce":"8ZUGuVqpz+hOlLl4aMAn7GyfSGU=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYwMjc1Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/29#issuecomment-457602757"},"message":"This is some sample RX infor:\n\noverride block 0x701f with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7020 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7021 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7022 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7023 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7024 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7025 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7026 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7027 with 0 fragments\noverride block 0x7028 with 5 fragments\n3600 packets lost\n87223632\tANT\t1\t11:-22:-20:-20\n87223632\tANT\t0\t11:-16:-14:-14\n87223632\tPKT\t11:0:11:8:3600:0\n87224633\tPKT\t0:0:0:0:0:0\n87225634\tPKT\t0:0:0:0:0:0\n87226635\tPKT\t0:0:0:0:0:0\n\nDoes it indicate failing to receive or failing to decrypt??","files":null}]}
