I wrote my own packet injection code and your radiotap header enabled me to inject with HT rates.\n\nI created a openwrt package for your project:\n\nhttps://github.com/booo/openwrt-wifibroadcast\n\nI still have to test the code. In the original wifibroadcast code there seams to be a problem with the pcap filters and non standard header format. Receiving packets does not work on openwrt targets.\n\nWith wifibroadcast for openwrt you can run wifibroadcast on a lot of popular wifi routers such as the atheros based hardware from ubnt.\n\nBest Regards\nPhilipp","files":null}]}
