With default settings WFB use MCS-1 HT40+ SGI modulation. It supports maximum bandwidth 30Mbit/s. It is sufficient for H264 720p 60fps or 1080p 30fps. But bitrate depends from video codec quality. For example different HW H264 codecs will provide **different** bitrate for the **same** video.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1537345373,"nonce":"9dREohnjC36+b/ecZv3nwtK5tlk=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjcwNTg3Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/16#issuecomment-422705876"},"message":"So you need to select modulation for you need - you distance, bitrate, interference, wifi band, etc.","files":null}]}
