This is strictly for compatibility with ISO C and has no effect; the 'b' is ignored on all POSIX conforming systems, including Linux.  (Other systems may treat text files and binary files differently, and adding the  'b'  may be a good idea if you do I/O to a binary file and expect that your program may be ported to non-UNIX environments.)\n\nYESï¼ŒI encountered a bug when porting this code to Windows.
