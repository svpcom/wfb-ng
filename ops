I used PX4 too as I double check. I remember ardupilot 3.6.x won't work for 115200 somehow with mavproxy.\nFor mavlink-router config, yes I did have them both. I currently set baudrate to 115200 but I'll try 1500000 too.\nI don't have NetworkManager since my RPI is ruuning raspbian stretch I guess NM is removed by default.\n\nThe acutal question is how my program could get involved in this link:\n[autopilot] \u003c--(uart)--\u003e[mavlink_router]--\u003e(udp 14550)--\u003e[wfb_drone]--...-(wifi)-...[wfb_gs]---\u003e(udp 14550)--\u003e[QGrondControl]\nBut as I double check mavlink-router I think I made some mistakes in understanding. I was hoping for some API to MavProxy but it seems I have to use Mavlink-router and build everthing on that myself?\n\nThanks again for your patience for all the questions. Great project and it's really amazing as I read through the codes.","files":null}]}
