I have finally managed to build and install 2 kernels with version `4.9.y`, one for _debian_(on _pc_) and one for the _raspberry pi_(_raspbian_) using [all these patches](https://github.com/rodizio1/EZ-WifiBroadcast/tree/develop/kernel) except `linux-4.9.28-dwc-otg.patch` and the 2 other patches for kernel `4.14.32`.\n    I tried to test wfb with [these instructions](https://github.com/svpcom/wifibroadcast/wiki/Troubleshooting). The raspberry pi doesn't have NetworkManager, and on Debian I added `unmanaged-devices=interface-name:thecorrectwlan` to `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`.\nFirstly I run lines 17-20 from [here](https://github.com/svpcom/wifibroadcast/blob/master/scripts/wfb-server.sh) to setup the wifi adapter(I replaced `$WLAN` with the true `wlan` address) on both _PC_ and _raspberry pi_.\n    When I run `sudo wfb_tx thecorrectwlan -K drone.key` on the _raspberry pi_ and `sudo wfb_rx thecorrectwlan -K gs.key` on the _PC_, and then I run `nc -lup 5600`(if I run as it is in the [wiki](https://github.com/svpcom/wifibroadcast/wiki/Troubleshooting): `nc -u 5600` I get an error like `no port[s] to connect to`) on the PC and run `echo test | nc -u localhost 5600` on the Raspberry Pi I get nothing.\n\nI think I have the same problem as @dposea.\nThere are no errors on either side. On the _rx side_ I get `XXXXXX Packet 0:0:0:0:0:0` or something like that, and on the _tx side_ I only get one line: `Listen on 5600 for thecorrectwlan`.\nMy wifi adapters are both _Alfa AWUS036NEH_ using _RT3070_.","files":null}]}
