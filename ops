It just seems like setting the channel manually with ```sudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 161``` refuses to work. Even if the driver isn't reporting the channel change, I'm unable to see a connection on either side of wfb. No log message mentioning bad encryption keys, etc. It's just as if it isn't pushing a signal out. \n\nI can see in wfb-cli drone and gs that packets are being injected on the tx side however. Just neither are receiving.","files":null}]}
