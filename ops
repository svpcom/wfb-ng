Isn't there a risk that the card will try to output at power exceeding its nominal value (btw, have you ever seen a case where it caused HW damage ?).\nI also don't quite get this part: \n`\n// CHANGES: set 58 for every data rate\nfor (i = 0; i \u003c Ar5416RateSize; i++) {\n    // ratesArray[i] -= AR5416_PWR_TABLE_OFFSET_DB * 2;\n    ratesArray[i] = 58;\n}\n`\nWhat does setting this to 58 do ? Also, why 58 ?\n\nRegarding [3], I can't really use that since I need to be able to switch back and from AP mode.\nI couldn't get [2] to work, yet but it's not really a priority :)","files":null}]}
