I modified the ground-station side to provide an access point so I can connect an Android tablet and my laptop, and a udp splitter that allows both of them to see video. The issue I'm having is that the mavlink connection seems really slow. If I attempt to upload a mission from an app running on my tablet or laptop, it takes a really long time to upload and fails pretty often from timeout errors. Is there a configuration change I can make to maybe give mavlink more bandwidth? Even if this comes at the expense of video quality, I'd be in favor of it. Thanks!","files":null}]}
