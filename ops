Or is it backward compatible? Because I downloaded the ground station firmware from openipc's official website, burning it into nvr can connect with my openipc camera and display images.\n![IMG_20241028_102111](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65ac5bbd-094f-4469-b0da-0e507f01c507)\n![IMG_20241028_102122](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e116883a-a689-4577-92ee-1927242b02f9)","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1730086169,"nonce":"Xbnp8OWiRw3AJi9WSjAgXkg3IKA=","metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDOBLCY8M6Rdrni","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/379#issuecomment-2440477154"},"message":"![new22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64b4cd7f-5c0a-4aec-805c-fef344dcfcd6)\nHello, I have been able to display pictures, but the delay and packet loss problems are very serious, is this situation related to my WiFi network card?","files":null}]}
