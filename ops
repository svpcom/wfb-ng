Those are the steps I am taking:\n\n1-I take the /boot folder from ezwifibroadcast and merge it on to a fresh raspbian image. That should change the kernel with the appropriate drivers right? \n\n2-I install the python stuff, and untar the prebuilt binaries as stated on the release notes.\n\n3- Then I generate encryption keys on my desktop ubuntu, and I place them as acorded on HOW TO page on the wiki, on /etc/ of each rpi3\n\n4-I create /etc/wifibroadcast.cfg on each rpi3, according to the HOW TO page of the wiki.\n\n5-I run systemctl daemon-reload and start each module on each pi, and seems to be all right. I put on .bashrc the comands for starting the modules on both pi.\n\n6-wfb-cli throws this:\nUsage: /usr/bin/wfb-cli \u003cprofile\u003e\nI don't know if it seems right. This should throw debug information about the working state of the system right?\n\nMaybe what I am missing is trivial but my knowledge on linux embedded is not as good as I would like it to be.\n\nI wouldn't mind to write a step by step guide for beginners for setting up this system, and upload some ready to burn images. I could as well complete the documentation of the project, I just need a few hints on how to set it up.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\nBest regards.","files":null}]}
