See http://mcsindex.com. To get effective bandwith divide radio bandwidth value by two. Or use `wfb-test-latency` program to test bandwith. This requires that TX and RX cards are connected to same machine.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1548220003,"nonce":"pi0H/QbG9198pFNeVZeJDbVCW64=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjY3MTg3OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/27#issuecomment-456671879"},"message":"Note, that 40Mhz channel is more sensitive to radio interference than 20MHz.","files":null}]}
