But to get RTP stream you need a video encoder (with encode raw data from camera to x264 stream). In my case RPI is only used for video encoding (becase RPI Zero is too slow to do anything else) and all other tasks (including wifibroadcast) are done by other board (NanoPI NEO2).","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1516648185,"nonce":"FdagUnQmEUYnsjNPoEZREXHijo0=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQzNTgyMzY3OA=="},"status":2}]}
