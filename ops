From my understanding `telemetry/server.py` is ran when the user types `systemctl start wifibroadcast@gs` or `systemctl start wifibroadcast@drone`. What's the difference between `telemetry/server.py` and creating 3 pairs of `wfb_tx` and `wfb_rx`, 1 pair for video and 2 pairs for bidirectional telemetry?","files":null}]}
