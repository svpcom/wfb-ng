And they will install the wfb-ng by scripts and most probable use forced installation without any device connected to the system.\n\n- for newcomers, install wfb with auto detection: `sudo ./scripts/install_gs.sh`\n- for people familiar with the wfb-ng(assign a pre-configured wlan device, such as `wfb-rf`) installation without wifi-card plugged: `sudo ./scripts/install_gs.sh wfb-rf` \n\nNote: wfb-rf will be configured by other scripts, such as udev configuration etc.\n\nBTW, if we want to remove $1 parameter, then readme might be need to be synced and comment about $1 parameter removed. So I think it might be a good choice for older users like me. What do you think?","files":null}]}
