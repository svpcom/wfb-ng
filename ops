Tunnel will be configured and work out of box. Drone side will have 10.5.0.2/24 address and GS - 10.5.0.1/24.\nSo you need:\n1. Install .deb package on the both machines\n2. Edit `/etc/default/wifibroadcast` and set `WFB_NICS=\"wlanXXX\"`\n3. Run `sudo systemctl restart wifibroadcast@gs` on the first and `sudo systemctl restart wifibroadcast@drone` on the second\n4. Use `ifconfig` or `ip link ls` to check tunnel interface","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1581092691,"nonce":"4aqfS9mlprQgqTG9aEEHiqFZF3g=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzQ4MjEyNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/51#issuecomment-583482125"},"message":"Builtin config file with all default values: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/telemetry/conf/master.cfg\nCreate /etc/wifibroadcast.cfg if you need to override some of them","files":null}]}
