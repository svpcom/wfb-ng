I need to write code to send data to one port and to listen to another port, but I don't know how to do that. I assumed I need to send UDP message, but I'm quite new to sockets in general. I don't need to use anything specific, I just need to make it work. Could you please give me a page to guide me or a short example? I have also [found this example which uses the Socket library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#example), look at the third example, the one with the packet sniffer. Is that what I need to use?","files":null}]}
