They were taken from https://github.com/bortek/EZ-WifiBroadcast as is. In case of TX powes limit - card select minumum of its supported power (stored in EEPROM) and CRDA power limit, so you shouldn't got HW damage.\n\n If you have recent mainline kernel (4.x) you don't need [2] (it already here). [1] and [3] are optional and needed only to increase transmit range and channel bandwidth.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1499274967,"nonce":"yFOiQK4mQTdp36vM383T5JmOZi4=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzE2ODI0Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/5#issuecomment-313168242"},"message":"Moved to wiki","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1499274967,"nonce":"fKS5yFW8U6pKAJRo9mLvEQOrnqk=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTE1MTMyNjAwMA=="},"status":2}]}
