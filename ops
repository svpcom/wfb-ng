Furthermore the Raspberry Pi 3 his very huge and heavy, which means it is no opportunity (about 44g).\nSo what about these boards:\nNanoPi-NEO2\t\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO2_Feature.html\nBanana Pi M2 Zero\thttp://www.banana-pi.org/bpi-zero.html\nNanoPi-NEO-Air\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO-air_Feature.html\nNanopi-Duo\t\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-Duo_Feature.html\nNanopi-NEO-Plus2\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO-Plus2_Feature.html\nNanoPi-NEO\t\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO_Feature.html\nNanoPi-NEO2\t\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO2_Feature.html\nNanopi-NEO-Core2\thttp://nanopi.org/NanoPi-NEO-Core2_Feature.html\nIs there something usable as Tx or do you have any other low price and low weight boards that could be used?\nI am very new to the Rasperry Pi world so you have to help me out a little bit. :)\nRegards\nDavid","files":null}]}
