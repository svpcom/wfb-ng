I have tried on one channel. But it still doesn't work. I think you are right. My Pi zero internal wifi card doesn't support packet injection. \n\nMaybe I need to buy an RTL8812AU wifi adapter for my Pi Zero. \n\nI just notice another wonderful project from you: https://github.com/svpcom/rtl8812au\n\nCan I use `sudo ./dkms-install.sh` to install this patch on any Linux OS?\n\nThanks","files":null}]}
