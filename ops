Not too concerned about interferences with RC radio, I'll either run my 900 mhz Crossfire or have the RC control sent via the wifibroadcast datalink. With the right antennas, I can get 5.8ghz to do the range, but it just isn't as robust of a link being higher frequency. Then again, 3x the bandwidth would make for some pretty nice video...\n\nNo, I haven't observed that limit, but then again, I wasn't really looking. I've tried the EZ-OSD on the same hardware and got very similar video results, if that helps. I'll let you know if I do see it in my further testing.","files":null}]}
