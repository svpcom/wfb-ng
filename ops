In the [px4 documentation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/qgc/video_streaming_wifi_broadcast.html#faq)\n\n\u003e The new version was rewritten to use UDP as data source and pack one source UDP packet into one radio packet. Radio packets now have variable size that depends on payload size. This significantly reduces a video latency.\n\n2. Or in the [this repo's wiki](https://github.com/svpcom/wifibroadcast/wiki/Setup-HOWTO)\n\n\u003e For IPoverWB (IPv4 over Wifibroadcast tunnel) you need only tun/tap kernel driver (tun.ko). Tunnel will be configured and work out of box. Drone side will have 10.5.0.2/24 address and GS - 10.5.0.1/24. Please note that tunnel use less efficient coding rate (to minimize latency) than video and mavlink streams and use it only for low-bandwidth traffic (like ssh), not as general link for video and telemetry streams.\n\nMaybe did you mean (in px4 documentation) that small UDP packages in summary takes less from common bandwidth and due to that video packages arrive faster?\n\n___\n\nAnd how it will be better to transmit large files (like 8MB JPEG images or 1GB video files) over WFB.\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
