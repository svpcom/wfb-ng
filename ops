We only cam about 1km at a free field with the RX 4m over ground.\n\nWe were wondering why at some point (\u003e 1km)   no packets anymore coming through to the RX PC / WFB. Also tcpdump showed no packets anymore. \nCould this be, because the \"fcsfail\" is not set by your script by default, and slightly broken packets are not let through? Other wfb implementations set this in there toolchain. Is there a reason for you to not set it? \n\nSadly we didnt test it today to just set it and see whats happing, but maybe you could give a small bit of info already for your reasons to not set it.\n\nThank you so much!","files":null}]}
