You should always see in real-time where your going and \"Return To Home\" when you lose video feed. We discourage unsafe flight methods that are based only on GPS navigation. We have seen many times the GPS reporting false data because of glitches. So please fly safe and always remember that safety comes first.","files":null}]}
