The router has both **wifi5**[Qualcomm Atheros **QCA9887**] and **wifi6**[Qualcomm Atheros **IPQ8074**] wireless network cards. I set them to the same channel and bandwidth. `wfb_rx` can decode data from the wifi5 wireless network card, but the data received from the wifi6 wireless network card cannot be decoded. **Thanks!**\n\u003cimg width=\"440\" alt=\"iw\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c400c024-b713-49c2-bd60-1bc85cf00284\"\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"461\" alt=\"iwinfo\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b831521-e31c-4040-a6d9-b61cd66429c2\"\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"1247\" alt=\"wfb-rx\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d44d86-e588-4dc0-9f65-25b5a00d875a\"\u003e","files":null}]}
