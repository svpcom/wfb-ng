Just use timestamp from flight controller (bundle it with IMU data). Because frequency of IMU readings \u003e\u003e video framerate they always will be correct. So proposed algorithm is:\n```\nwait for mavlink from /dev/ttySXX or RTP packet:\n    if mavlink:\n          timestamp = data\n          imu = data\n    if rtp:\n        send_udp(timestamp, imu, rtp_data)\n```","files":null}]}
