Which version of Jetpack are you using? I tried to load the module with modprobe and got \n`modprobe: ERROR: could not insert '8812eu_jetson': Exec format error`\nWhich I believe may be caused by the kernel version in which the driver was compiled being different from the one I am currently running, since dmseg outputs\n`8812eu: disagrees about version of symbol module_layout`\n\nIt should be worth mentioning that I downgraded to Jetpack 6.1 since the original post for other reasons relating to pytorch.","files":null}]}
