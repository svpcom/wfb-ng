I guess it would need way less bandwidth and be more resistant to temporary network glitches. A photo could be updated at constant periods, say every 10 seconds, and during this time the tx could send the same photo over and over again (or its fragments if it has received an acknowledgment about some part successfully transmitted).\n\nMotivation: I'm mostly flying by waypoints, so this could be a way of checking if everything goes fine, no unexpected masts, power lines etc. The system could switch to video if the available bandwidth would be appropriate.","files":null}]}
