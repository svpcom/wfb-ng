May I ask if the five binaries migrated above can only use them to receive data? Thank you!!\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80fd953b-4547-4d72-82c1-9a47534758c5)\n2 block overrides\n3 packets lost\n41 block overrides\n15603 packets lost\n40 block overrides\n15335 packets lost\n40 block overrides\n14435 packets lost\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/802caaa2-e238-455d-9b9f-cea1a7fcf409)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40e67de9-baab-41b6-b8e6-0b3245ad0a93)","files":null}]}
