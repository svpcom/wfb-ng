I think that my issue was power related. I have my TX wired to a separate power source and got EZ-wifibroadcast working. I still want to experiment with your version as well as the OSD. when i run tx_standalone.sh i dont get any errors but I am not sure it is actually transmitting. When EZ-wifibroadcast runs i can hear the network card buzz and it will get warm. Neither of those two things happen when I run tx_standalone.sh","files":null}]}
