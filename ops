I don't have other brands of wifi6 devices for more testing now. I have uploaded the data packets obtained on Ax211 to onedrive. Maybe it's the IPQ8074 driver problem or OpenWrt. I'm not a professional and don't have the ability to conduct in-depth analysis. I really want to use wfb_rx on the wifi6 openwrt router and hope you can give a solution. Thank you.","files":null}]}
