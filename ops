I'm using TL-WN722N on both rx and tx. Ive used these very wifi cards with the befinitiv wifibroadcast a while back. I have new os installations on both rx and tx so I dont know if the driver are the same used back then. I found on the manual setup guide by befinitiv (https://befinitiv.wordpress.com/wifibroadcast-analog-like-transmission-of-live-video-data/wifibroadcast-fpv-manual-setup/)  how to patch the firmware. Will give it a try and get back to you.\n\nThank you for your reply :)","files":null}]}
