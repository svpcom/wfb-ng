The system works in two ranges, `2.4Ghz` and `5Ghz`.\n\nI checked the functionality with the `rtw88_8822bu` driver built into the kernel. With default settings the system refused to work, data is not sent or received.\nAfter I changed the line to `frame_type = 'rts'`, the connection worked, but the transfer speed was unacceptably low, about `50Kb/s`.\n\nI was able to achieve stable operation using a [custom kernel module from RinCat](https://github.com/RinCat/RTL88x2BU-Linux-Driver). Using this code, the connection speed through the tunnel was about `8Mb/s`. On standard `wfb-ng` settings.\n\nBased on the data I received, the chip can be used. As soon as I have more data, I will let you know here.","files":null}]}
