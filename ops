Yes. Original wifibroadcast  pack incoming data from the pipe and send a new wifi packet only if it is full. This affects to latency because x264 frame size is not equal to wifi packet size.\n\n2. Video stream use 8/12 fec rate (only 50% overhead). This mean that for recover one or more lost packet you need to receive 12 packets. Video has constant packet rate so delay will be small. But for example TCP stream for ssh connection will not have constant rate, so you will got freezes in case of packet lost. Due to this IPoverWFB use 1/2 fec rate (100% overhead). This allow to recover one packet lost without awaiting other packets.\n\nFor you case it depends:  How frequently you will get lost packets? If there is noisy environment with burst noise - you can use 8/12 or (for example) 80/120, but you will need to send additional traffic (or modify wfb sources to emit empty packets) to close fec block.","files":null}]}
