I am using 2.4GHz Alfa AWUS036NHA Wifi cards (with Atheros AR9271 chipset) as both TX and RX modules. My /etc/wifibroadcast.cfg on drone side looks like following\n`[common]\nwifi_channel = 1       # 161 -- radio channel @5825 MHz, range: 5815â€“5835 MHz, width 20MHz\n                       # 1 -- radio channel @2412 Mhz, \n                       # see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels for reference\nwifi_region = 'BO'     # Your country for CRDA (use BO or GY if you want max tx power)\n\n[drone_mavlink]\npeer = 'listen://0.0.0.0:14550'   # incoming connection\n#peer = 'connect://127.0.0.1:14550'  # outgoing connection\n\n[drone_video]\npeer = 'listen://0.0.0.0:5602'  # listen for video stream (gstreamer on drone)\nbandwidth = 40     # bandwidth 20 or 40 MHz\nshort_gi = True   # use short GI or not\nstbc = 3          # stbc streams: 1, 2, 3 or 0 if unused\nldpc = 0\nmcs_index = 23      # mcs index`\n\nThe most I could transmit without greying out and excessive lag was 400,00 bit rate and 60 fps. Has anyone else experienced such limitations with 2.4GHz or is there a way to increase the TX throughput for 2.4GHz system or I am at the limit?","files":null}]}
