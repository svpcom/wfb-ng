FEC(N, K) use K input packets and issue (N - K) checksums. FEC can encode and decode only full block (K messages). If number of packets to send is not divisible by K, then TX FEC block will not closed, and only new latency test run will close it. In case of packet loss you will wait for K packets of the last FEC block on the RX side which will only arrive when new test run close FEC block (and issue checksum packets) on TX.\n\nThere are two ways to deal with it:\n1. Restart wfb_rx and wfb_tx between latency test runs\n2. Add `-T timeout_in_ms` to wfb_tx to close FEC block on timeout (it will issue null packets to FEC if no new packets arrives during specified timeout). For example you can add `-T 100`","files":null}]}
