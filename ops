Try this:\n1. Change `wifi_channel` from 165 to 1 in config file (some cards are incompatible with 5GHz band)\n2. Check that NetworkManager is disabled or your wifi cards are blacklisted in its config. (``unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan1,interface-name:wlan2``)\n3. Check that wifi cards have enough power (RPI has too weak usb ports for high-power wifi cards). Check them on linux PC or use external +5V (or powered USB hub) for wifi cards.","files":null}]}
