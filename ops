(i need patches only for old 3.x.x kernels). I've test it with rt2x00 (ralink card) which has driver inside of mainline kernel. What kernel version do you have? But maybe injection in ath9k is broken - I don't use these card in my setup. My primary cards now are rtl8812au and previous were rt2x00.\n\nYes. It is known issue for rtl8812au - you need to reduce tx power (via driver patch or via `wifi_txpower` in config file - see `telemetry/conf/master.cfg` for default value) on the short distance.","files":null}]}
