Great work! :)\n\nI tried to use it but I'm facing some issues. When I tried to stream video, Video stream are totally corrupted (ex: almost all grey  or Y data almost not existing, depending on the method use).\n\nHowever, basic tests seems to work properly, I can send messages without issues between the drone and the GS. But when I tried to send large data it seems it is mostly lost, which could explain my issue. For instance I did a for loop to count till 1000000 on TX side, that I netcat to WFB, and I redirected the RX output to a file to count how many were recieved: I had almost 90% of the messages lost. I did similar tests with video files and had also big loss.\n\nDo you have any idea on what could cause this issue?\n\nI'm using raspberry pi 4 with TPLink w722n wifi adapter.\n\n\nThank you for all your work!","files":null}]}
