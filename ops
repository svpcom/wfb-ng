I've seen your portfolio - could you advice dc-dc for powering such wifi cards? Most of powerful 8812au and 8812eu cards consume \u003e 3A in pulse when transmitting and generic dc-dc converters from aliexpress requires additional low-esr capacitors to survive these pulses. Are any better (an cheap) solution to power such cards from 3S-6S batteries?","files":null}]}
