Then the application need to:\n\n- increase the transmitting power\n- enlarge the bandwidth\n- decrease the bitrate\n- etc\n\nin order to get a stable feed without any glitches if possible.\n\nAnd wfb-ng is a communication foundation of the FPV video trasmittion backbone tunnel. Hope there are hooks or interfaces for dynamic tunnings.\n\nThen there are chances for link quality management. what do you think?\n\nPS: I might be wrong, please correct me if I missed something.","files":null}]}
