Then I checked that the generated binary file is indeed a file that can run on the arm platform. May I ask how I should put it on the embedded device? On Linux x86 systems there is a systemctl start wifibroadcast@gs command to boot, how to boot on embedded platforms?\n![QQ图片20241209162816](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f82b13a3-16b7-4bd2-9bda-e947c99b9c75)\n![QQ图片20241209162825](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4152820f-0411-49d8-97b0-bbe0bc28b052)\nAbove is the compilation of the final error picture, and the format of the binary file.
