Yes. WFB doing injection of RSSI packets into MAVLink traffic. Also raw mavlink stream could be unidirectional (for example if vehicle  is TX only and ground station is RX only) but UDP link require to be bidirectional\n2. WFB doesn't use retransmissions (i.e. don't use ACK's as ordinary WIFI) for error correction. It use FEC instead. If FEC unable to recover data - you will got a gap. Using different FEC coding rate you could achieve immunity to different types of interference.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1612644142,"nonce":"UWY6RCAhVy2PxmdCl+D3M/W7ZD4=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI5OTUxMzY0Mg=="},"status":2}]}
