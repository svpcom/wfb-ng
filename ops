Have not still test tx side with my atheros cards. But any way with Mediatek 7662 it work perfect. (Net of forwarding stations connected throw ethernet)  \nNow I try to use mesh network of forwarding stations to send data to  aggregate station.\nI try  to use batman-adv based mesh. (https://medium.com/swlh/setting-up-an-ad-hoc-mesh-network-with-raspberry-pi-3b-using-batman-adv-1c08ee565165)  Of course I use separate cards and WiFi channel in mesh and broadcasting. \nI succeed in starting mesh network (I can use ssh etc) but if I try send wifibroadcasting data throw it, I'v got't \"unable to decrypt packe ...\" on most lines of output on aggregate station. Even if mesh have only two nodes and lie on the table. \nI try to use Raspberry Pi as aggregate station or route traffic to my laptop and aggregate on it.  \nMay be you have some good idea for something like it.\n\nP.S. I understand that this solution may be dead end when I try to scale it. But it's looks very attractive to use wifi mesh instead of wire ethernet.","files":null}]}
