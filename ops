When tx we known all packet sizes and send first K packets with their original sizes (to reduce bandwidth), but when calculating FEC, we pad them to max(size_of_first_k_packets). So only (n-k) (i.e. only FEC packets) will be large size. But when rx we don't known max_packet_size (because we can miss one of first K packets) so we can use MAC_FEC_PAYLOAD for zero padding and fec decoding.  Yes, you can optimize it and use size of FEC packets. I don't remember why I use MAC_FEC_PAYLOAD instead of it.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1608054318,"nonce":"tRp2qbAT9a35xkkul7Pkh6tTXa0=","metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTQ1NDIwNw==","github-url":"https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/issues/71#issuecomment-745454207"},"message":"See https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/zfec for FEC docs","files":null}]}
