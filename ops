It is IC design flaw or bad schematics? All three dc-dc in my test dies identically:\n\nI am seeing the power mosfet burn out. IC: `tps5430`\nPossible causes:\n- Transistor not fully opened (transistor control system did not have time to enter operating mode)\n- Load starting current is excessively high (output capacitance is too high + load is too powerful).\n- Internal oscillatory processes have occurred in the system.\n\nSolution:\n- Do not load DCDC at full power at the moment of starting (in reality, this is a very rare scenario)!\n- Choose an IC for DCDC with a soft-start function\n\nP.S. I have never used this power supply at a current greater than 2A. The recommended current is 1.5A","files":null}]}
