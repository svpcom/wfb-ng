Using a raspberry pi 3b on tx side and have the same problem. Cant use higher bitrate than ~500 000 before picture gets gray. The video stream works with higher bitrate for the first 2 seconds of the stream though it seems. As I understand it @svpcom is using a nanopi to actually run wfb, so I am thinking if maybe it could be the memory bandwidth or something like that could be the bottle neck. If it isnt memory bandwidth or some code bug and @svpcom can run it fine on his setup with a bitrate of 4000 000 without problem I'm kinda clueless. \n\nWould very much appreciate some insight from @svpcom.","files":null}]}
