Furthermore using a raspberry pi has a lot disadvantages, due to the fact that the RaspPi is heavy, huge and expensive for it's performance.\nThe Nanopi Neo2 is by far the best solution.\nThat is the reason why I want to ask for a Nanopi neo2 Image. Could you create that for the TX?\nI think most people are going to use the Logitech c920 beacuse it is the best cam you can get for this project. The Nanopi Neo2 is small, lightweight, powerful and with 20$ in my opinion very cheap.\nSo if you are going to create an prebuild image I would use the Nanopi Neo2.","files":null}]}
