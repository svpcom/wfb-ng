I am testing on two Raspberry Pi 3B's, both using @svpcom's https://github.com/svpcom/rtl8812au driver. I was getting \"No link\" in `wfb-cli` so I followed the troubleshooting steps with no luck. `echo test | nc -u 127.0.0.1 5600` blocks on the transmitter, and `tcpdump` only seems to be picking up probe requests from nearby access points. I've tried both devices acting as transmitter and receiver, as well as both on the same machine and on different machines.\n\nDo you have any additional steps I could try, or code modifications that might need to be done?","files":null}]}
