I figured i would try to change the channel.... tried 148, 150, 155 but on both computers either as tx or rx this is the error i got\n\nSetting wlan1 to channel 155\ncommand failed: Invalid argument (-22)\n\ni admit, advanced networking like this is beyond my skills so i am not sure where to go from here. I did notice though that the RPI tcpdump i always see each line with \"6.0 Mb/s\" while on the desktop i see \"6.0 Mb/s and 12.0Mb/s\" do you think there is something not correct with the ubuntu drivers for the RT3572 chipset? I also have no patched the kernel/firmware on either computers since I am trying to keep things simple to start as well as never having done that process. Thanks again for your help and hard work!\n\nEDIT: i have heard these particular network adapters are power hungry and can cause the RPI3 to have issues. I have a good power supply to the RPI3 and on the desktop the adapter is connected directly to my motherboards USB3.0 higher power port. I was hoping that for testing i can use the desktop as the tx to avoid the power issue and just have the RPI3 as the rx until I get some power/BEC hardware setup.\n\nalso, hoping i am making the tx and rx keys correctly. I am just running keygen on the desktop, leaving both rx.key and tx.keys as well as copying both of those to the RPI3 directory where the rx and tx binaries are.\nEDIT again lol, i noticed that if I comment out \"#iw dev $WLAN set bitrates ht-mcs-5 1 sgi-5\" on the tx/rx_standalone.sh scripts that when running tcpdump -i \u003cNIC\u003e -n -p on both tx/rx the outputs match and seem in sync as wel as both showing after what looks like the current time 6.0 Mb/s\n\n20:55:34.392134 6.0 Mb/s 5745 MHz 11a -67dBm signal antenna 1 Beacon (TG1672GF2-5G) [6.0* 9.0 12.0* 18.0 24.0* 36.0 48.0 54.0 Mbit] ESS CH: 149, PRIVACY\n\nSorry for such a long post, trying to be specific to make things easy.
