In main features you mentioned \"Distributed operation. It can gather data from cards on different hosts\" \nWe working on video translation for orienteering project. And we are looking for solution which will make possible gathering one video stream from more then one RX host.\nWe need it because some times forest is not radio transparent. Our idea is to create wired network of controller on some area where operator can move. So we need some re-transmitter from WiFi to wired network and then some kind \n RX program which will get data  from wired interface and give us picture (or RTP ...) \nIs \"Distributed operation\" is feature we need? And if it is how we can configure it.\n\nBest Regards. \nDenis\nP.S. I already try classic wifibroadcasting and re-transmitter using tcpdump -\u003enetcat -\u003enetcat -\u003e tcpreplay \nI can't say it doesn't work at all but I'v got lot of artifacts and some time stream fail. Seems that tcpreplay take to much processor time.","files":null}]}
