In /etc/majestic.yaml you can set rtp packet size\n2. For 8812au/eu with latest drivers mtu (max udp packet size) is 3993 but see note https://github.com/svpcom/wfb-ng/blob/4ea700606c259960ea169bad1f55fde77850013d/src/wifibroadcast.hpp#L103\n\nIf you will try to inject packet larger than wifi mtu then it will be truncated and you will unable to decrypt it on the RX side.\nAlso all mtu \u003e 1500 may have interoperability issues with non 8812au/eu cards (for example with ath9k)","files":null}]}
