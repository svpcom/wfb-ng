So we need to accumulate them in some place and yield full (or partial if we have sufficient number of parts for FEC) packet.\nIf we get fragments in-order (without drop) we don't need to wait for FEC (n-k) packets and can yield fragments without delay. If we have one or more dropouts then we must wait for all other fragments to recover missed parts from FEC.","files":null}]}
