I use Alfa Network AWUS036ACH with https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au/ (v5.2.20, because v5.3.4 doesn't have injection support). It transmit on full power by default (crda and tx power limit is disabled in driver code) and txpower setup doesn't work. Also I found that it transmit on full power (27dBm) only in 2.4G band. In 5.8G band max measured power is 14dBm","files":null}]}
