I've already tested them.  But I'll implement your sugesstion to have clean encryption logic.\n\nArgon2 key derivation eats alot of memory and cpu (because it provides bruteforce protection) and recalculate it during every wfb_tx/rx start will be very slow and can lead to out of memory condition (especially on cheap devices like openipc cameras and openwrt routers). Also having password as cmdline argument vs key in the file is less secure, because every user ( or process in system) can run `ps` and read it","files":null}]}
