We noticed the quality was improved on his PC when we added the wlp3s0 internal antenna on the transmission script. But the same doesn't occur on my PC, when I add the internal antenna (wlp2s0) to the transmission (further the external antenna that I'm using to stream).\n\nThe HW setup is:\n\nTX: alfa AWUS036NH with 9dB antenna\nRX: alfa AWUS036NH with 9dB antenna\n\nBoth computers running Ubuntu 16.04\n\nWiFi card specs on my PC:\n\n                description: Wireless interface\n                product: QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter\n                vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n                physical id: 0\n                bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n                logical name: wlp2s0\n                version: 32\n                serial: d8:0f:99:bf:ee:dd\n                width: 64 bits\n                clock: 33MHz\n                capabilities: bus_master cap_list logical wireless\n                configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath10k_pci driverversion=4.15.0-46-generic firmware=WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00079-QCARMSWPZ-1 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11\n\nWiFi card specs on my friend PC:\n\n*-network\n                description: Wireless interface\n                product: QCA9377 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter\n                vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n                physical id: 0\n                bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n                logical name: wlp3s0\n                version: 31\n                serial: 98:83:89:94:46:31\n                width: 64 bits\n                clock: 33MHz\n                capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n                configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath10k_pci driverversion=4.15.0-46-generic firmware=WLAN.TF.1.0-00267-1 ip=192.168.42.28 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11\n                resources: irq:127 memory:ef200000-ef3fffff\n\nOutput during the streaming on my PC:\n\n8 packets lost\n13 packets lost\n1086331\tANT\t1\t102:-55:-48:-45\n1086331\tPKT\t103:0:103:50:44:0\n13 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n12 packets lost\n16 packets lost\n1087331\tANT\t1\t136:-47:-45:-43\n1087331\tPKT\t137:0:137:64:49:0\n14 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n1088331\tANT\t1\t128:-47:-45:-45\n1088331\tPKT\t128:0:128:74:38:0\n30 packets lost\n7 packets lost\n10 packets lost\n7 packets lost\n2 packets lost\n7 packets lost\n1089331\tANT\t1\t132:-47:-45:-45\n1089331\tPKT\t133:0:133:57:63:0\n8 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n24 packets lost\n16 packets lost\n1090331\tANT\t1\t123:-47:-44:-43\n1090331\tPKT\t124:0:124:55:56:0\n15 packets lost\n6 packets lost\n16 packets lost\n33 packets lost\n1091331\tANT\t1\t105:-49:-46:-43\n1091331\tPKT\t105:0:105:35:70:0\n23 packets lost\n8 packets lost\n15 packets lost\n1092331\tANT\t1\t113:-51:-47:-45\n1092331\tPKT\t114:0:114:57:46:0\n15 packets lost\n7 packets lost\n17 packets lost\n16 packets lost\n1093331\tANT\t1\t129:-49:-46:-45\n1093331\tPKT\t130:0:130:47:55:0\n\nSorry for this generic question, but I didn't understand what is happening with my wifibroadcast streaming.","files":null}]}
