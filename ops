I think the issue was jetpack does some weird kernel mods to cfg80211. When you go to compile the drivers, it has checks for what kernel version you have an adjusts some variables based on that. However the kernel patches nvidia added makes those checks useless. I spent way too long fixing that up to get it to compile.\n\nI added the pre-compiled driver to this git https://github.com/aepkolol/jetson-8812eu","files":null}]}
