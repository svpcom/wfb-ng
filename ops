Packets aresent, verified with tcpdump, but the receiver always prints something like Packet XXXXXX 0:0:0:0:0:0 , always 00's. I think I uncommented  the fprintf for that data  in rx.cpp. I tried to capture the data with wireshark on my laptop but never saw anything.  I can't see any reason for receive to fail. Most of my stuff is in storage because my girlfriend and I moved into a condo on the beach, so I have one rt28xx wifi card and one 1900AC. They work very well with EZ-Wifibroadcast but your version seems to be a better solution for for low latency if I can get it to work. Any ideas?","files":null}]}
