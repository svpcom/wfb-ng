Libpcap 1.9.1.\nBtw, posting the tcpdump output was stupid. Seems capturing and looking in wireshark is easier and what I see is that the data is the same and the headers in atheros are fill with more stuff, but wireshark is able to get the ethernet src and dest in both captures so I dont know what is wrong. Maybe the filter since it seems to be applied on an address directly?","files":null}]}
