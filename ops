Other kernel versions may have whatever issues that are not directly apparent, for example USB timing issues that lead to higher packetloss or instabilities that are hard to reproduce and may only show up under certain conditions or after many hours of running.\n\nAlso should I do this?\n\u003e Put these options (in exactly that order!) at the end of cmdline text: dwc_otg.fiq_fsm_enable=0 dwc_otg.fiq_enable=0 dwc_otg.nak_holdoff=0 dwc_otg.int_ep_interval_min=0","files":null}]}
