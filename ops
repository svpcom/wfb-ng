You need to disable original wifibroadcast tx and rx and upload my version_ \u003e\n\nBut I don't know what to do with your prebuilt binaries. I can't find where to replace them in borteks image !\n\nI need a little help, please ...\n\nps : have you ever think of sharing your code with bortek ? Perhaps he could include it for next updates.\n\n(I'm sad when I see people working each on its own side ...)","files":null}]}
