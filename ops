Can you connect both network adapters to PC with linux?\n2. They will be wlan1 and wlan2 (or wlan0 and wlan1 if you don't have builtin wifi).\n3. WN822N has Atheros AR7010 or AR9287 (according to wikidevi.com) it is 2.4GHz only and I've never tried it as TX (injection mode). Lets it will be RX (receiver).\n4.  D-link DWA-137 is a Ralink RT5372 - same 2.4GHz. Lets use it in injection (TX) mode.\n5. Edit rx_standalone and add ``-u 5601`` to rx arguments.\n6. Run rx_standalone and tx_standalone scripts with appropriate wlan cards.\nIf there are some error messages, rerun scripts with ``bash -x`` to localize which command fails.\n7. If previous steps were succeed run ``nc -u -l 5601`` and ``echo test | nc -u localhost 5600``","files":null}]}
