Here is what I ended up doing: I went to the source file that was causing the issue, `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/setuptools/_core_metadata.py`, and I commented out the offending line and saved with `canonicalize_version(version),` . This is absolutely terrible and is not the correct way to solve the issue on my side, but at least I got it to compile the package and it continued to finish, and I've been playing with the working system since. I hope this isn't just my Ubuntu 22 environment; has anyone else run into this? On a side note, I just about trashed my Ubuntu install by installing Python 3.12 and then trying the update-alternatives mechanism to modify the default python instance, to great disaster, but I was able to revert back.","files":null}]}
