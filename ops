After doing some research, I'm still confused on how to setup and install a tun/tap kernel driver for Ubuntu. I understand what a tun/tap kernel driver does in theory, but how to install and use it in this application is still unclear. Do you have some references you could point me to? Or, perhaps, a list of commands to run? If I'm able to set it up, I'll try to contribute to the wiki a more detailed guide on setting it up.\n\nThanks,\n\nMilan","files":null}]}
