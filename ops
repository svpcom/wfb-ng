I am not a software developer but am a quick study and I understand that this means downloading the kernel source code from the [www.raspberrypi.org github repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi), using the \"patch\" application to modify that source code, then building the kernel, presumably to end up with a new \"kernel.img\" file.\n\n- Firstly, have I understood the 4.75 million web pages I've had to read to to be able to say all that! ;)\n- Secondly, building the entire kernel for some minor changes seems like a lot of effort (and processor time), is there an easier way, for example, just \"make\"ing the files that are changing?\n\nAppreciate you helping out a noob here.","files":null}]}
