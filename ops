Check, that mavlink data available from /dev/ttyAMA0 (also that uart speed is correct both on autopilot side and linux side).  You should have something like this in mavlink router config:\n```\n[UartEndpoint px4]\nDevice = /dev/ttyAMA0\nBaud = 1500000\n```\nI recommend to use telemetry speed 1.5M (for px4) because some arm boards (for example neo2) unable to set exact freq from slower uart speeds.","files":null}]}
