I was wondering is stream redirecting possible?\nFor example, I use RPI for the ground side to receive the video stream then it redirects the video stream to my iPad or Macbook for decoding. I just notice that there is an iOS App called QGroundControl which can decode the video stream at the same time.\n\nIf it's possible, maybe I can use Pi zero as the ground receiver and more powerful devices for decoding.\n\nthanks a lot for your hard work and for making such an amazing project.","files":null}]}
