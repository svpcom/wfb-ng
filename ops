It's simple to fix the warning by adding a cast to the format function. There are lots of articles on printf exploits and how they create a security issue. It's not a really big concern on a raspberry pi but something I am now aware of and try to pass along to other developers. I had no idea until about 6 months ago that such a big security hole existed. Nearly every program I have written has a printf in it.\n\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android \n \n  On Tue, Nov 13, 2018 at 1:35, Vasily Evseenko\u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:   \nThis is not a bug but a compiler warning. string_format function is line snprintf but outputs to a STL string. Old gcc is not smart enough and generate a warning due to non-literal format string and varargs as argument list\n\nâ€”\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.","files":null}]}
