I'm using an onboard CSI camera from the development kit and Pixhawk autopilot.\n\nI have a bunch of questions,\n\n1. I run the following command to capture video from CSI and direct to h264 localhost port,\ngst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc ! nvvidconv ! omxh264enc ! 'video/x-h264, framerate=(fraction)30/1, stream-format=(string)byte-stream' ! h264parse ! rtph264pay mtu=1400 config-interval=1 pt=96 ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5600\n\nThen, I'm using mavproxy route to redirect telemetry from autopilot usb to port,\nmavproxy.py --baudrate 115200 --out 127.0.0.1:14551 --state-basedir=/tmp\n\nThen, I've compiled osd project and just simply running ./osd command to get the video with telemetry OSD as the output. The QUESTION is as follows, when the video just appears I can see the picture fine, but within 1-2 seconds it goes gray with some artifacts like on the television screen. I keep osd running and cover the camera lens with my finger and then quickly remove my finger and I can see the clear picture again for 1-2 seconds and then it goes grey again, why does this happen???\n2. I require to do the following,\n\n- capture video from camera into jetson\n- put OSD on the video in jetson\n- direct video with OSD to UDP stream\n- capture video from jetson on a client device\n\nI will also require the telemetry to be sent in both directions via the same UDP ethernet channel, however, your projects are based on wifi, and I'm trying to understand how I can send my traffic via UDP ethernet, instead of wifi broadcast? It'd be good to start with understanding on how to run osd project and instead of seeing the video on the jetson screen it's sent to a udp source?\n\nThanks for your time, I would really appreciate to have some pointers on the questions above as I'm fairly new to the topic and trying to wrap my brain around it.","files":null}]}
