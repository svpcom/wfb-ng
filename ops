Sorry, I haven't used openWrt much. \n\nI spent all day getting openWrt working on an [ASUS AX4200](https://openwrt.org/toh/asus/tuf-ax4200) after it initially bricked the router, but monitor and packet injection works flawlessly on 5ghz with it. It was a last ditch effort to get something I had on hand working, but it paid off. So I can confirm whatever chipset/driver combo is on that router fully works with wfb-ng openWrt. \n\nI do have a weird issue where as soon as QGC connects to the drone over wfb, the drone stops its mavlink stream though. This happens with every device combo I have tried so far. Telling the GCS to not set vehicle stream rates and not emit heartbeats helps, dunno why. But I only get it with wfb-ng, I need to investigate further. 10 seconds or so after QGC connects, I can see in wfb-cli that no mavlink packets are being sent across from the drone.","files":null}]}
